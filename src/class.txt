if we difine a class with no constructors the complier implicitly places  default constructors in your class but if we difine even one constructor
 the complier doesnot does nothing
A class can have one more than one constructor provided each constructors argument are differenrt iin number or datatype this is called constructor overlading


note: a constructor is like a method that can have argument name is same as class name and no return type and not even void 

method should have return type
we can ues data members and class name as method name
this refers to the calling object;
static block run one time;
non static block run for every objects
static 
non static
constructor

A class can contain one or more static blocks to make a static block we write the word static folloewed by brace brackets
ex: static {}
A static block called once in the entire program whenever the class is loaded into the memory.
it can be used to perform tasks that must be executed only once before starting any program.
A class can contain one or more static blocks it is created by directly writing brace brackets without any keyword it is called everytime an object of that class created
but before the constructor.
It can be used to perform task just after object creation.
